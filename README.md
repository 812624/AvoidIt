# AvoidIt
It is a simple **chrome extension** to put a check on YouTube uses.

## The Story :-
- In past few months I experienced my attention being distracted from my academics and a big chunk of my time is being lost in YouTube videos, I soon realised that I need to put a check on it before it's too late. While browsing the methods of avoiding, I came accross the extension idea and tried to built one for myself.

###### Functionalities :-
- You can select the time limit by hitting *Edit Avoid Time* button.
- You can check the time left by hitting the *Time Left* button.
- Timer will keep runnig as long as *edit window* is kept opened.  

###### Areas to be improved :-
- Extension must be working even if user closes all windows or even shuts down the system.
- *Edit Window* and *Time Left* can be made good looking.
- Initially idea was to make *Avoid List* where user can put all the websites she wants to put a check on, since it was my first attemt to make an extension so I kept it simple for the first time.
- There will be sepearte timer for the seperate websites in *Avoid List* version.
